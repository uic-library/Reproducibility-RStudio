-------------------------------------------
What are the features in RStudio beyond running R scripts and can help you keep your research project organized? This hands on workshop covers advice for project management in R, working with R project files and using Git version control in RStudio with the aim of making your projects easier to share and more reproducible.Â 

This workshop uses the project files and adapted version of the paper: "Trier social stress test and food-choice: Behavioral, self-report & hormonal data." by authors Nitsch, F. J., Sellitto, M., & Kalenscher, T. published in Data in brief in 2021 with permission of the authors for instruction purposes. The paper DOI is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107245.
